Exercise 1:

Create units test to verify the CardApplicationService fully complies to all the requirements (spoiler alert: there is a bug)

The CardApplication determines if a client will be approved for a new credit card, it produces a result in the form of CardApplicationResult
which provides the output of the clients card application.

There are two main types of clients, employed and and the riskier unemployed.

If no bank accounts are supplied the service will respond with: CardApplicationResult.NO_BANK_ACCOUNT_DECLINED

Employed :
    A employed client is allowed no more than 1 account with a negative balance otherwise the service will respond with : CardApplicationResult.EMPLOYED_OVERDRAFT_DECLINED
    A employed client must have a total balance of 5000 or more otherwise the service will respond with : CardApplicationResult.MIN_BALANCE_DECLINED
Unemployed
    A unemployed client is not allowed to have any accounts with a negative balance otherwise the service will respond with : CardApplicationResult.UNEMPLOYED_OVERDRAFT_DECLINED
    A unemployed client must have a total balance of 10000 or more otherwise the service will respond with : CardApplicationResult.MIN_BALANCE_DECLINED

If all conditions are met the service will respond with CardApplicationResult.APPROVED
